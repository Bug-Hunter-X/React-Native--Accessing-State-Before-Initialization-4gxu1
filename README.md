# React Native: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: accessing state variables before they have been initialized, often during asynchronous operations like data fetching.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents a corrected version.

## Problem
The issue arises when the component tries to render before the state has been populated from an asynchronous action (e.g., a network request).  This results in an error as the state might be `null` or `undefined`.
